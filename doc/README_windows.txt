Intro
-----
DotCoin is a free open source project derived from PPCoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake and scrypt
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
After completing windows setup then run windows command line (cmd)
  cd daemon
  dotcoind
You would need to create a configuration file dotcoin.conf in the default
wallet directory. Grant access to dotcoind.exe in anti-virus and firewall
applications if necessary.

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 20001 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  PPCoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the PPCoin network.
